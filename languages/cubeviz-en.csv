DataSelectionModule_AttributeDialogDescription;In the following list, different units are available for selection. As the default, CubeViz selects one out of the list automatically, but you can change the selection according to your needs. Please note that you are only allowed to select one of the listed items.

DataSelectionModule_ComponentDialogDescription;In the following form, those dimension elements are listed that are used to express the context of the corresponding statistical observations. This is a multiple choice selection, which means that you are able to select a minimum of one and a maximum of all items. Please note that you have to select at least one item. If you select all items it can happen that the server has to respond with a very huge set of data which can can slow down the response and processing time.
DataSelectionModule_ComponentDialogMainTitle;Dimension Element Selection 
DataSelectionModule_ComponentHelpDialogDescription;The selected RDF dataset contains statistical context information of the observations. In a DataCube such contextual information are expressed as dimensions and dimension elements. To select observations of your interest you have to select elements belonging to these dimensions. The available dimensions are available in the box. Below every dimension the amount of selected and available dimension elements is diplayed. To change the slection please use the selection dialogue for each dimension.

DataSelectionModule_DataSetDialogDescription;In the following item list, the DataCube datasets available are part of the given dataset. These DataCube datasets are used to fragment the set of statistical data items. In order to visualize a chart using CubeViz, select one of the DataCube datasets below.
DataSelectionModule_DataSetDialogTitle;Dataset Selection 
DataSelectionModule_DataSetHelpDialogDescription;The selected RDF dataset contains a subdivision called “DataCube datasets” which are used to group different statistical data items. The structure of a DataCube dataset corresponds to a specific data structure definition. There may be cases where different DataCube datasets share their corresonding DataStructureDefinition. In the selection dialogue you have the option to change the selected DataCube dataset. If you do not select one of the subdivision, CubeViz will select one automatically.

DataSelectionModule_SelectAttributeAndMeasureHelpDialogTitle;Why are there different measurements and units?
DataSelectionModule_SelectAttributeAndMeasureHelpDialogDescription;Sometimes a dataset contains different measurement and units. This is the case where a statistical observation is being expressed for different purposes. For instance, a spatial distance between two things can be expressed using centimeter and meter. To improve the comparability of observations the user should determine both the measurement and the unit. Please use the selection dialogue to configure this according to your needs.

DataSelectionModule_SelectComponentsIconText;What is a dimension and why should I select elements belonging to a dimension?
DataSelectionModule_SelectComponentsHelpText;Each data set contains statistical data. These data is a collection of so-called observations. Under an observation you can picture a point in a room. This point has coordinates which locates him at a specific position in this room. In general these coordinates are 3 dimensional: height, width and deep. In the DataCube context these coordinates are dimensions and it is possible to have more than these 3. But these dimension are not positions in a room, you may think, but could be everything, like a scala of money (e.g. from 1000 EUR to 100.000 EUR).

IndexAction_NotificationHighChartsException10;That chart can not be produced because the selected data contains zero or subzero values. Please change the configuration in the left sidebar or use another Scale value but not Logarithmic.
IndexAction_NotificationNoDataFitsSelection;No data fits to your selection, please adapt your selection in the left sidebar manually.
IndexAction_NotificationNoDataFitsSelectionExplanation;This behavior can have various reasons. On the one hand it is possible that there is no data available according to the selection. In order to reduce the load of the server we decided not to check the availability of data for every selection. <br/><br/> On the other hand it is possible that a chart can not be produced if the user selects inapplicable combinations of options such as a logarithm scale in combination with percentage stacking. Trapping such cases is not yet fully implemented but will be done soon. <br/><br/>To solve such problems we suggest to change the selection and/or the selected chart options.
