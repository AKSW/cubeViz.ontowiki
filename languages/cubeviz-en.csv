DataSelectionModule_SelectComponentsHelpText;Each data set contains statistical data. These data is a collection of so-called observations. Under an observation you can picture a point in a room. This point has coordinates which locates him at a specific position in this room. In general these coordinates are 3 dimensional: height, width and deep. In the DataCube context these coordinates are dimensions and it is possible to have more than these 3. But these dimension are not positions in a room, you may think, but could be everything, like a scala of money (e.g. from 1000 EUR to 100.000 EUR).

DataSelectionModule_SelectDSDialogDescription;In the following item list, the DataCube datasets available are part of the given dataset. These DataCube datasets are used to fragment the set of statistical data items. In order to visualize a chart using CubeViz, select one of the DataCube datasets below.

DataSelectionModule_SelectDSHelpDialogTitle;What is a dataset and why should I select one?
DataSelectionModule_SelectDSHelpDialogDescription;The selected RDF dataset contains a subdivision called “DataCube datasets” which are used to group different statistical data items. The structure of a DataCube dataset corresponds to a specific DataStructureDefinition. There may be cases where different DataCube datasets share their corresonding DataStructureDefinition. In the selection dialogue you have the option to change the selected DataCube dataset. If you do not select one of the subdivision, CubeViz will select one automatically.

IndexAction_NotificationHighChartsException10;That chart can not be produced because the selected data contains zero or subzero values. Please change the configuration in the left sidebar or use another Scale value but not Logarithmic.
IndexAction_NotificationNoDataFitsSelection;No data fits to your selection, please adapt your selection in the left sidebar manually.
IndexAction_NotificationNoDataFitsSelectionExplanation;This behavior can have various reasons. On the one hand it is possible that there is no data available according to the selection. In order to reduce the load of the server we decided not to check the availability of data for every selection. <br/><br/> On the other hand it is possible that a chart can not be produced if the user selects inapplicable combinations of options such as a logarithm scale in combination with percentage stacking. Trapping such cases is not yet fully implemented but will be done soon. <br/><br/>To solve such problems we suggest to change the selection and/or the selected chart options.
