Module_SelectComponentsHelpText;Each data set contains statistical data. These data is a collection of so-called observations. Under an observation you can picture a point in a room. This point has coordinates which locates him at a specific position in this room. In general these coordinates are 3 dimensional: height, width and deep. In the DataCube context these coordinates are dimensions and it is possible to have more than these 3. But these dimension are not positions in a room, you may think, but could be everything, like a scala of money (e.g. from 1000 EUR to 100.000 EUR).
