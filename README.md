# Visualization of statistics in the Linked Data Web with CubeViz

CubeViz is based on the award winning Semantic Wiki technology [OntoWiki](http://ontowiki.net/Projects/OntoWiki) 
which offers possibilities to visualize statistical data in a generic way. The statistical data itself has to be 
in [RDF data format](http://localhost/ow_cubeviz_odp/www.w3.org/RDF/) designed by using the 
[RDF DataCube vocabulary](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/). The Visualization of and the access to statistical 
data becomes more and more important since the amount of available data in the web is increasing. CubeViz addresses 
this issue and offers user-friendly exploration possibilities. At the moment CubeViz offers basic chart types to explore
up to two dimensions in a data structure. Due to the fact that statistics can be much more complex, we will offer more 
chart types and additional facetted browsing possibilities as part of CubeViz in the near future.
